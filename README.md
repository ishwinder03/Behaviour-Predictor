# Behaviour-Predictor

This set of code utilizes a random forest machine learning algorithm to analyze survey data and classify individuals into five distinct personality types based on their responses. The resulting segments are then used in correlation and clustering analyses to identify connections between personality types and new datasets.

The ultimate goal is to enable personalized interventions. For example, in healthcare, individuals in Segment 5, characterized as 'Strong Survivors' who are less proactive about their health, could receive tailored strategies such as frequent appointment reminders on their phone to improve engagement.
